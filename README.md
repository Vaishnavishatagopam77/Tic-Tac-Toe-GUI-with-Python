# Tic-Tac-Toe-GUI-with-Python
Here ,I will introduce you to an advanced Python project on Tic Tac Toe GUI with Python. This game is very popular and is quite simple in itself. It is a two-player game. In this game, there is a board with 3×3 squares.
# Introduction
A player marks one of the 3×3 squares with his symbol (perhaps “X” or “O”) and he aims to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intensions:

1.Create a straight line before your opponent to win the game.

2.Prevent his opponent from creating a straight line first.

If no one can logically create a straight line with its symbol, the game ends in a tie. So there are only three possible outcomes: one player wins, his opponent (human or computer) wins, or there is a tie.

# Game Setup:
The game board consists of 9 squares, arranged in a 3x3 grid.
One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square.
# Rules:
Turn-taking: Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty square on the grid.

Winning: A player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, which can be:

Horizontally (across any row),
Vertically (down any column), or
Diagonally (from top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left).

Draw: If all squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw or "cat's game."
# Strategy:
First move advantage: The player who goes first (X) generally has an advantage.

Corner control: It's often helpful to start in a corner because it opens up multiple ways to win.

Block: Always watch for your opponent’s moves and block their potential winning row if necessary.

Tic-Tac-Toe is simple to understand but can still involve strategy, especially if both players know how to block and create opportunities.
